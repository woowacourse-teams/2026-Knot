description: Draft and validate Pull Requests for the 2026-Knot backend from the actual backend git diff and its linked GitHub Issue, including parent and sub-issue context, branch and title conventions, PR template, commit scope, and verification results. Use when Codex needs to prepare or review a Knot backend PR, but do not publish it unless explicitly asked.

# Knot PR

Use this skill from the repository's `backend` module directory for backend PR drafting and review. Do not rely on a user-specific absolute path. If the skill is invoked from another directory, resolve the checkout dynamically:

~~~bash
repo_root="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
backend_dir="$repo_root/backend"
cd "$backend_dir"
~~~

The PR is based on two sources:

1. the actual backend change shown by `git diff`;
2. the GitHub Issue linked from the branch.

The diff is the source of truth for what changed. The Issue is the source of truth for why it changed and what must be checked. Do not describe Issue TODOs as completed work unless the diff and verification support them.

## Operating rules

- Work from the `backend` directory. Resolve the Git repository root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` when reading root-level rules.
- Treat the repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/knot-conventions.yml`, and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` as project sources of truth. User instructions override them.
- Do not commit, push, create a PR, edit an Issue, add labels, or close an Issue unless the user explicitly requests that exact write action.
- Separate drafting from publishing. Publishing requires confirmation of the final title, base, head, Issue linkage, and body.
- Do not claim tests, formatting, review, or Issue completion unless a command or GitHub state proves it.
- Flag unrelated commits, files, generated artifacts, pre-existing dirty changes, and branch-rule mismatches instead of hiding them.

## 1. Resolve branch, base, and linked Issue

Run these read-only checks from `backend`:

~~~bash
git status --short --branch
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git log --oneline --decorate -20
git diff --stat -- .
git diff --name-status -- .
git diff --cached --stat -- .
git diff --cached --name-status -- .
git diff HEAD --stat -- .
git diff HEAD --name-status -- .
~~~

Resolve the base branch from an existing PR when available; otherwise use the repository default branch or configured upstream. Do not assume `main`.

Parse the current branch using the repository convention:

~~~text
<area>/<type>/#<issue-number>
~~~

For the current Knot rules:

- area: `be` or `fe`;
- type: `feature`, `bugfix`, `chore`, `docs`, `hotfix`, `refactor`, or `release`;
- issue-number: the numeric Issue identifier after `#`.

Quote branch names containing `#` in shell commands. If the branch does not match the configured pattern, report the mismatch; do not silently rewrite the branch or title.

Fetch the Issue identified by the branch using the GitHub connector first. Read its title, state, labels, assignee, parent, sub-issues, and sub-issue summary. Use a narrow GitHub CLI/API fallback only when the connector cannot provide a field.

Report the hierarchy separately from the PR body:

~~~text
상위 이슈: #... or 없음
현재 이슈: #...
하위 이슈: #... — 제목 — 상태 or 없음
~~~

Do not infer that every child or sibling is part of this PR. If the branch Issue is a sub-issue, use the parent for context and keep the branch Issue as the default PR link.

## 2. Build the implementation evidence from the diff

Inspect the complete change represented by the backend, in this order:

~~~bash
git diff -- .
git diff --cached -- .
git diff HEAD -- .
git diff <base>...HEAD -- .
git diff --check <base>...HEAD -- .
git log --oneline <base>..HEAD -- .
git diff --stat <base>...HEAD -- .
git diff --name-status <base>...HEAD -- .
~~~

Use the first three commands to include unstaged, staged, and local-but-committed changes. Use `<base>...HEAD -- .` from the backend module directory to represent the branch's committed backend PR scope relative to the resolved base. If the working tree is dirty, distinguish pending local changes from the committed branch diff.

For untracked files, use `git status --short -- .` and inspect only the listed files relevant to the Issue; plain `git diff` does not include untracked files.

Then map the Issue to the diff before drafting:

~~~text
요구사항 | diff 근거(파일/변경) | 검증 근거 | 상태
~~~

Classify each requirement as `충족`, `부분 충족`, `미충족`, or `검증 안 됨`. The PR 작업 내용 must summarize only changed behavior and structure evidenced by the diff. Missing or unrelated work belongs in 참고 사항 or blockers.

Check the scope explicitly:

- changed files belong to the linked Issue and backend area;
- implementation and direct tests are included when the Issue requires tests;
- setup or generated files are explained;
- sibling Issue work is not presented as this PR's work;
- commit messages describe one coherent change;
- the branch diff does not accidentally include unrelated commits from the base point.

## 3. Build the PR title from the Issue

Use the linked Issue title as the semantic source, but do not let it override the diff's actual scope.

- Preserve `[BE]` or `[FE]` when it matches the branch area.
- Add `[BE]` for `be` or `[FE]` for `fe` when the Issue title has no area prefix.
- Keep the Issue wording by default; do not invent a different feature name.
- Flag a title/Issue/diff mismatch instead of silently changing the Issue's meaning.
- Ensure the title follows the repository title pattern and its area matches the branch.

Expected form:

~~~text
[BE] Notion 페이지 조회 기능 구현
~~~

## 4. Draft the PR body

Use the repository template's exact headings. Remove placeholder comments from the final draft.

~~~markdown
## 관련 이슈

- #<branch-issue-number>

## 작업 내용

- <git diff로 확인된 변경 동작 또는 구조>
- <주요 변경 파일/범위>

### 참고 사항

- <상위/하위 이슈 관계, 제한 사항, 검증 결과>
~~~

Rules:

- Keep `관련 이슈` and `작업 내용` exactly; the repository validator requires both.
- Put the branch Issue number in `관련 이슈`; it must match the branch number.
- Use `Closes #number` only when the user explicitly wants automatic Issue closure. Otherwise use `- #number`.
- Write `작업 내용` from the diff, not by copying the Issue description.
- Mention parent and sub-issues in `참고 사항` when they clarify scope or when the user asks for hierarchy visibility.
- Include actual verification commands and results.
- State incomplete tests, known formatting failures, unrelated changes, or deferred requirements explicitly.
- Never claim the Issue is complete merely because code exists on the branch.

## 5. Verify readiness

Run the smallest relevant checks and report the actual result:

- governance tests from `backend`: `python3 -m unittest discover ../.github/scripts -p 'test_*.py' -v`;
- Java backend changes: `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew spotlessCheck`;
- existing PR governance check when a PR exists: `python3 ../.github/scripts/validate_governance.py --repo OWNER/REPO --pr PR_NUMBER`.

If no PR exists, manually validate the draft against the configured branch pattern, title pattern, exact headings, Issue reference, diff scope, and Issue-to-diff evidence table. A successful test task may still have zero relevant tests; inspect the test scope before claiming behavioral coverage.

Return:

~~~text
PR 준비 상태: 준비됨 / 보완 필요
~~~

List blockers separately from optional polish. Include the exact branch, Issue hierarchy, title, body, changed scope, commits, requirement mapping, and verification status needed for review.

## 6. Publish only on explicit request

When the user explicitly asks to create or publish the PR, confirm the final title, base, head branch, Issue linkage, and body first. Do not close the Issue or add extra Issue references without permission. Use the repository's GitHub publishing workflow for commit, push, and PR creation rather than performing those mutations during a draft-only request.
